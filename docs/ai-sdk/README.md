# AI SDK V5 Documentation

Complete knowledge base for building agents and LLM applications using AI SDK V5.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into three complementary guides:

### 1. [AI SDK V5 Complete Guide](./AI-SDK-V5-Complete-Guide.md)
**The comprehensive reference - start here!**

- Complete coverage of all AI SDK V5 features
- Core concepts and fundamentals
- Detailed explanations with examples
- Best practices throughout
- Perfect for learning from scratch or as a complete reference

**Topics covered:**
- Installation & Setup
- Core Functions (generateText, streamText, streamObject)
- Providers & Models
- Streaming (text, objects, UI messages)
- Tool Calling & Agents
- Message System (UIMessage, ModelMessage, parts)
- Working with Images and Files
- Persistence
- Advanced Workflows
- Context Engineering (Prompting)
- Custom Data Streaming
- Error Handling
- Evals & Testing
- LLM Fundamentals (tokens, usage, context window)
- Best Practices
- Complete Examples

### 2. [Advanced Patterns](./Advanced-Patterns.md)
**Production-ready patterns for sophisticated applications**

Advanced techniques for building robust, production-grade AI applications:

- **Guardrails**: Protect your application from inappropriate queries
- **Model Routers**: Optimize costs by routing queries to appropriate models
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Integrate pre-built tool servers
- **Breaking Agent Loops Early**: Control when agent loops terminate
- **Comparing Multiple Outputs**: Generate and select the best response
- **Message Metadata**: Track performance and display information
- **Custom Stream Parts**: Create rich UI experiences

### 3. [Quick Reference](./Quick-Reference.md)
**Fast lookup for common operations**

A cheat sheet for quick reference:

- Common imports
- Basic operations
- API patterns
- Code snippets
- Debugging tips
- Common errors and solutions

## Based On

This documentation is synthesized from:

1. **AI SDK V5 Crash Course** repository exercises and examples
2. Official Vercel AI SDK documentation and best practices
3. Real-world patterns from production applications

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/anthropic @ai-sdk/google zod

# Create .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_key

# Start building!
```

See the [Quick Reference](./Quick-Reference.md) for common code patterns.
